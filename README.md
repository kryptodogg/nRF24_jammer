  <h1> 🌟 nRF24 Jammer (Rust Port) 🌟 </h1>
</div>

Welcome to the **nRF24 Jammer Rust Port** repository! 🎉 This is an ongoing effort to port the ESP32 and nRF24 based jammer to Rust.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This project is a **Rust port** of the original nRF24 Jammer. It is intended for **personal use and educational purposes** and is **not intended to replace** the [original C++/Arduino project](https://github.com/W0rthlessS0ul/nRF24_jammer). For the official tutorial, firmware, and stable release, please refer to the original repository.
